## Me

Hey, I'm Timothy Ransom. A Family guy and tech enthusiast. I am married and I am a proud dad to two amazing kids. Originally I am from South Africa, I spent 12 years living in Dubai and now life's taken me and my family to the United Kingdom.

I've been working in IT since 2014, mostly in Microsoft technologies like Microsoft 365, Azure, and Intune and more!

## My blog

I've faced my fair share of roadblocks while implementing various things, often searching online for solutions. Whether I uncover the answers myself or gather insights from different sources, I feel the need to consolidate and share my findings in a more concise space.

This blog is my way of paying it forward. I'm not an expert, but I've got experiences to share. Maybe you'll find a nugget of wisdom here that'll make your tech journey smoother.
